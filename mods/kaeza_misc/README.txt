Well, I've developed a few mods for testing new features in the engine (back
when they were new anyway).

Since these mods have nothing in common, and are rather smallish, I don't
want to clutter up the forums with lots of topics. I'll be posting more here
as I push them to my repo (and I find where I left them :P).

Mods
----

Currently, these are the things added:

bookex
  This overrides the default book. When used, you can write something in it.
  Useful for taking notes and such.

testclock
  This was to test the new Lua HUD system. It adds a clock that shows the
  time of the day (in-game).

To uninstall a mod, just remove it from the pack :)
