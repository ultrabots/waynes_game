if you would like an almost flat world 
;please read completely before doing anything...............


I suggest you add the mod mg_villages by Sokomine
https://github.com/Sokomine/mg_villages/archive/master.zip

and then create a v7 map ,
	DO NOT click PLAY
click CONFIGURE and enable the mg_villages mod
	DO NOT click PLAY

copy ' map_meta.txt ' from this folder into your new map folder overwrite or delete the old file

OK you CAN click PLAY now 
and hopefully you will have an almost flat world....
